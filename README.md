# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox

## Plan on improving the project

While working on this project, I identified a potential improvement that could enhance the user experience and overall functionality: Optimize the layout further for different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on all devices.
